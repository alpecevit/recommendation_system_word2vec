# Building a Recommendation System Using Word2vec
  In this project I have built a recommendation system with the purpose of recommending similar products for a specific product using the product view data of users. I have created a web service and containerized it using Docker. Code for the model and the service can be found in this repo. I created another venv for the deployment of the web service which I will not be pushing to this repo. However, the Dockerfile that I am using can be found under the 'service' directory.
